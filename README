raw2x README
Release version: 0.2.1 (Dec 07 2005)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About:
------

raw is a re-implementation of the engine used in the game Another World. This 
game, released under the name Out Of This World in non-European countries, was 
written by Eric Chahi at the beginning of the '90s. More information can be 
found here : http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,2/gameId,564/.

GP2X Version:
-------------------

There is a TODO list with some features not yet implemented in this version:

- Make sound less noisy.
- More than one state in save state system
- More screen resolutions for TV-Out mode

I really don't know if you can finish the game in this version. if you can
test it or you find some bug, please let me know. Thank you.

CHANGELOG
-------------------
0.3.1 (Dec 21 2005)
  - Sound system works. But it sounds a little noise i think.
  - Filesystem syncronization after save a state to avoid data loss

0.2.1 (Dec 07 2005)
  - Better controls. Now you can't jump using upper diagonals. Instead use R button.
  - Save/Load state with X and Y buttons respectively
  - Screen centred verticaly
  - Game can be finished in this version (tested). This doesn't ensure you 
    could finish it in future versions until tested.
